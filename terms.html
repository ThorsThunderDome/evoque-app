    <main>
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the Evoque application ("Service") within the Pi Browser, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Evoque is a platform that allows users ("Supporters") to support content creators ("Creators") through subscriptions. The Service is provided as-is and is currently in a beta or hackathon development phase. All transactions are currently simulated and do not involve real Pi currency.</p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To use Evoque, you must authenticate using your Pi Network account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.</p>

        <h2>4. Creator Content</h2>
        <p>Creators are solely responsible for the content they post. Evoque does not endorse and is not responsible for any content created by users on the platform.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall Evoque, nor its developers, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time.</p>
